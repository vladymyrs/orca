 * `for-each-ref` argv listing every local ref that could collide with

 *
 * A `for-each-ref` pattern matches a ref completely *or* up to a `/` boundary,
 * so `refs/heads/feature` returns both `refs/heads/feature` and
 * `refs/heads/feature/x` while never matching `refs/heads/featurex`. One
 * invocation therefore covers both directions: the requested name's own pattern
 * finds refs nested under it, and each proper-prefix pattern finds a shorter ref
 * blocking it.
 *
 * Known limitation: `for-each-ref` matches ref names byte-for-byte, while the
 * ref *store* on macOS/Windows is usually case-insensitive and may normalize
 * unicode. So `Feature/x` blocking `feature`, or an NFC ref blocking an NFD
 * name, is not detected here and still reaches git. `--ignore-case` is
 * deliberately not used: on a case-sensitive volume git genuinely allows both
 * `feature` and `Feature/x`, so it would block names git accepts — a false
 * positive, which is worse than the raw error this misses. Those cases fail
 * exactly as they do today.
 *
 * Safe for git 2.25 — multi-pattern `for-each-ref` long predates the baseline.
 * Every argument is `refs/heads/`-prefixed, so a branch name can never be read
 * as an option, and `check-ref-format` has already rejected the glob characters
 * (`*?[\`) that would otherwise make these patterns match too much.
